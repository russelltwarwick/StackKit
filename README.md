# StackKit

### Introduction

StackKit is a Swift Package that leverages UIStackViews and Swift's ResultBuilders. With this powerful combination, developers can effortlessly construct declarative UI using only UIKit. Whether you aim to enhance your programmatic UI or avoid the need to migrate existing projects to SwiftUI, StackKit offers an ideal solution. Its API design closely aligns with SwiftUI, ensuring a seamless learning experience without the necessity of adapting to reactive programming patterns and can support projects that support older versions of iOS. Explore StackKit and unlock the potential of UIKit for streamlined and intuitive UI development.
